# Running ruby password checker

From the `ruby` directory run `$ ruby app.rb` and follow instructions

To run the specs, please install rspec using `$ bundle install` (again from the ruby directory)
then run `$ rspec`

# Running the typescript checker

From the `js` directory please run `npm install`

Then from that directory run the file, with your password as an argument:
`$ ts-node tschecker.ts yourPasswordHere_1`

# Running the Go one

If you have go installed, from the go directory run `go run checker.go yourPasswordHere`
Don't worry if you don't have it installed, as it's a silly language.
